## **1. Introduction** :pushpin:

- **About La Liga**: La Liga is one of the most popular professional sports leagues globally hosted in Spain. The competition format follows the usual double round-robin format. During the course of a season, each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for 40 matches. Although there are 20 teams in total, only 3 clubs attract most of soccer fans' attention: <strong>Real Madrid, Barcelona</strong>, and <strong>Atletico</strong> on their way to get the trophy. This analysis, thus, would mainly concentrate on these 3 big guys, to provide some meaningful insights about why the winners win and the losers lose. 

- **Objective**: This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on available information related to players, and generate some insights behind the top 3's current performance.

- **Target Audiences**: The findings may provide some meaningful insights for soccer management stakeholders, football club managers, as well as business working on sports industry.

## **3. Findings Summary** :bulb:

<img width="1000" alt="·∫¢nh ch·ª•p M√†n h√¨nh 2023-03-20 l√∫c 04 19 49" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104643138/226206716-d969c7d3-bd92-4230-8a73-96544e2e3cbd.png">
- It can be seen that <strong>Atletico</strong> has the <strong>highest</strong> age median among the top 3, especially compared with <strong>Barcelona</strong>.</p>

<img width="1000" alt="·∫¢nh ch·ª•p M√†n h√¨nh 2023-03-20 l√∫c 04 20 17" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104643138/226206732-6bda54cd-565b-41fe-9eca-c442fc859299.png">
- It can be seen that <strong>Atletico</strong> lies in the oldest teams, while <strong>Barcelona</strong> contains comparatively younger squad. This would help Barcelona maintain and develop their play style and strategies in the next seasons</p>

<img width="1000" alt="·∫¢nh ch·ª•p M√†n h√¨nh 2023-03-20 l√∫c 04 22 37" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104643138/226206820-ed0456f7-8802-47eb-8fbf-90e8246b9897.png">
- It can be clearly seen from this chart that <strong>less than 20%</strong> players of Atletico aged 26 and under, while young players aged U26 account for more than <strong>50%</strong> and <strong>60%</strong> in Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively.</p>

<img width="618" alt="·∫¢nh ch·ª•p M√†n h√¨nh 2023-03-20 l√∫c 04 23 41" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104643138/226206866-b560b9a9-fe57-4e50-800e-3fbafedfc62e.png">
- The average Age is shown to have a <strong>negative correlation</strong> with a team's goal number, though the statistical meaning is not significant (~-0.25)</p>

<img width="762" alt="·∫¢nh ch·ª•p M√†n h√¨nh 2023-03-20 l√∫c 04 24 48" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104643138/226206933-7ccf6ec3-066d-4278-9116-5550f5b2afff.png">
- While there are many options for scoring goals in Real Madrid, Barcelona is quite dependent on Lewandowski who delivered <strong>32%</strong> of the team goal. This could be the reason why they can't compete with Real Madrid in a long-term race like Laliga, though they have just won Real Madrid in the latest match. Meanwhile, A.Griezmann and A.Morata are delivering more than <strong>50%</strong> of Atletico goals.</p>
